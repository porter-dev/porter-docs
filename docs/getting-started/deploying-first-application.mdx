Now that you've created your Porter cluster, you can deploy your first application to it. In this example, we'll create a fun Tetris application to verify that everything is working correctly.
## Deploy a new application

On the Porter dashboard, navigate to the **Applications** tab. From here, click on **New application**, and you will be redirected to the application launch view, where you can configure everything about your application:

Give your app a name (e.g. 'porter-tetris'), and then select **Docker registry** as the deployment method. Specify **uzyexe/tetris** as the container image.

Next, add a new service of type **Web**, and give it a name (e.g. 'web'). Once you see your web service appear in the list of services, change its **Container port** to 80, if it isn't already. We won't need to change anything else about this service for now, but don't worry - all these settings can be changed later.

Finally, simply hit **Deploy app** to finish creating your application.
## View your Application

You will be redirected to the dashboard of your application, where you can reconfigure everything from the application launch view, as well as view events and metrics for your application:

All that's left to do is to click on the link underneath your application name, and start playing Tetris!

## Application Cleanup

To delete this application, click on the **Settings** tab of the application and click **Delete**.
