In order to offer Github login, you will need to set up an OAuth application in Github that will authorize reading Github user data. To offer reading from/writing to Github repositories, you need to create a Github App in Github. In this guide, we assume you are setting up a Github integration for a Porter instance running on `porter.example.com`. Let's get started!

## Setting Up Github Login

### Step 1: Github OAuth Application Creation

:::info

**Note:** you can view the most up-to-date instructions for creating a Github OAuth app in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

:::

Navigate to your organization settings page (alternately, you can navigate to your personal settings page) and select **Developer Settings** in the sidebar. Go to **OAuth Apps** and select **New OAuth App**. You can fill it in with the following fields:

- **Application name:** Porter
- **Homepage URL:** https://getporter.dev
- **Authorization callback URL:** `https://<your-domain>/api/oauth/github/callback`

The registration form should look something like this:

After creating the OAuth application, select "Generate a new client secret" and store the secret value somewhere. You will need this for the next step.

### Step 2: Update Porter Environment Variables

Add the following Github credentials to your Porter instance:

```sh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your-github-client-id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-github-client-secret>
```

**Note:** if you ever want to enable Github login, you can set the environment variable `GITHUB_LOGIN_ENABLED=false`.

:::

Restart the Porter instance, and you will be given the option to log in with Github!

## Setting Up Github Repository Integrations

### Step 1: Github App Creation

Navigate to your organization settings page (alternately, you can navigate to your personal settings page) and select **Developer Settings** in the sidebar. Go to **Github Apps** and select **New Github App**. You should use the following settings:

- Callback URL: `<protocol>://<your-domain>/api/oauth/github-app/callback`
- The **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** checkbox should be checked.
- Webhook URL: `<protocol>://<your-domain>/api/integrations/github-app/webhook`
- Webhook secret: generate a random webhook secret for your domain, for example by running `cat /dev/urandom | base64 | head -c 32`.
- Permissions:
  - Repository Permissions:
    - `Actions`: `Read and Write`
    - Contents: Read and Write
    - Metadata: Read-Only
    - Secrets: Read and Write
    - Workflows: Read and Write
  - Organization Permissions:
    - Members: Read-Only
  - User Permissions:
    - Email Addresses: Read-Only

### Step 2: Downloading a Private Key

After creating the Github App, generate a new private key for your app. Put this private key either somewhere in your filesystem, or mount it into the container if using Kubernetes or Swarm to deploy.

### Step 3: Update Porter Environment Variables

Add the following Github credentials to your Porter instance:

```sh
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=<github-app-id>
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=<github-secret>
GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<webhook-secret>
GITHUB_APP_NAME=<github-app-name>
GITHUB_APP_ID=<github-app-id>
GITHUB_APP_SECRET_PATH=<path-to-secret>
```

### Troubleshooting

If your Github app is connected properly and is showing the correct accounts on the Porter dashboard, but the repos aren't displaying on the Porter dashboard, you can check that the webhooks have been delivered properly from the **Advanced** tab of the Github app's settings. From there, you can view recent webhook deliveries and ensure that they were delivered successfully. If they were not delivered successfully, you can redeliver them or debug the request from this tab.
