With Porter, you can configure Slack notifications which allow your cluster to notify your team in case issues arise with your applications. You can also set up more advanced monitoring alarms, in order to monitor your applications and the underlying infrastructure in a far more fine-grained manner.

For more detailed instructions on setting up Slack notifications as well as advanced monitoring alarms, see the links below:
