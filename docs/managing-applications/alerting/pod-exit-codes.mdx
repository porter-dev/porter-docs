title: Pod Exit Codes

Porter uses Kubernetes under the hood. This means that all of your applications are [`Deployments`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) with their individual [`Pods`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/). These pods run containers inside of them which may crash because of a variety of errors.

We have compiled a list of the most common exit codes that may help you find the root cause of a crash.

**Note:** This list is non-exhaustive.

- A valid exit code is between 0 and 255, 0 means that the container exited normally. You may find this to be the case with [`Job`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) containers.
- Generally speaking, if the container exited due to an internal signal then the exit code is between 1 and 128 and if it exited due to an external signal, the exit code is between 129 and 255.
- The above will not hold true if the application programmer chooses to follow a different convention of using exit codes.

## Typical exit codes

- `137`: indicates that the process was killed by `SIGKILL`. One possible reason is that the pod was out of memory.
- `1` and `255`: indicates common issues. Check container logs for further troubleshooting. For example, this could be the result of `exit(1)` or `exit(-1)`. `-1` is translated to `255`.
- `2`: This could happen because of a misuse of a shell builtin when using Bash.
- `126`: A command was invoked that could not be executed by the system.
- `127`: Command was not found. Please check your `$PATH` or for a possible typo.
- `128`: Invalid argument to `exit()`.
- `130`: Process terminated with `Ctrl+C`.

**Note:** Normally, an exit code of `128+n` denotes the fatal signal `n` from the standard [Linux interruption signals](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html).
