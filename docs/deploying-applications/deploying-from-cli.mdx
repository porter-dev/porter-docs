Porter lets you create and update applications using the CLI. By default, the CLI builds your application, pushes it to a Docker registry, and re-deploys your application on Porter. Note that these commands are used internally when you [deploy from Github](./deploying-from-github) or [use your own CI tools](./using-other-ci-tools).

:::info Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster and container registry linked to Porter (linked by default if you following the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started/overview))
- The Porter CLI installed ([view installation instructions](../cli/installation)).

:::

This section contains the following guides

- [Creating an Application from the CLI](./deploying-from-cli/creating-an-application)
- [Updating an Application from the CLI](./deploying-from-cli/updating-an-application)
- [Common Configuration Options](./deploying-from-cli/common-configuration-options)

For a full overview of the CLI, see the [CLI section of the docs](../cli/installation).
