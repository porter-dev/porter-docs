To deploy a new application from Github, first navigate to the **Applications** page in Porter, and click **New application**. Here you will find a form titled **Deploy a new application**:

### Step 1: Select a Github Repository

After giving your application a name, you will see two options for launching your application: **Git Repository** and **Docker Registry**. Select **Git Repository**. Search for your connected repositories and select one. If you are not seeing your desired repository, consult the [Adding/Updating the Porter Github App](./adding-updating-gh-app) guide.

### Step 2: Select a Branch

Once you select a repository, you will be asked to select a **source branch** for that repository. When pushes are made to the **source branch**, Porter will automatically build the branch's code and re-deploy your application. For example, if you are setting up a production cluster, you might want your application to be deployed on pushes to the `production` branch.

### Step 3: Select a Root Path

After selecting a branch, you will need to specify the root path of your Github repository. This is commonly `./`; however, if your repository is a monorepo, you will need to specify the path to the subdirectory from which you would like your Porter application to be built (e.g. `./backend`).

### Step 4: (Optional) Specify a Build Method

After you select a branch, Porter will automatically detect whether your repository contains a Dockerfile, as well as the buildpacks needed to build your application. You can make changes to these settings by expanding the **Configure buildpacks/Dockerfile settings** section. For more information on how Porter builds your code, see here.

### Step 5: Add Application Services 

You can now add services to your application, which will be deployed together once your code is built. They are divided into three types: **Web**, **Worker** and **Job**. See [here](../overview#types-of-applications) for more information about the difference between service types.

If you had written a `porter.yaml` file as outlined in the [Writing a porter.yaml](./writing-a-porter-yaml) guide, you should see this list populated with the services you defined in your `porter.yaml`. **Any settings you specify for your services in your `porter.yaml` will be read-only in the Porter UI.** If you would like to make changes to your services, you will need to make them in your `porter.yaml` and push them to your repository.

### Step 6: (Optional) Add Environment Variables
After adding services, you can add environment variables to your application. These environment variables will be available to all services in your application. In addition, if there are any environment variables required to build your code, specify them here.

### Step 7: (Optional) Add a Pre-Deploy Job
You can also add a pre-deploy job to your application. This job will run its start command before your application services are deployed, and can be used to run database migrations, seed your database, or perform any other tasks that need to be completed before your application services are deployed.

### Step 8: Set Up CI/CD through Github Actions
After clicking the **Deploy app** button at the bottom of the form, you will see instructions for setting up CI/CD through Github Actions. This will allow you to automatically build and deploy your application on pushes to your source branch. Follow the instructions, then click **Deploy app** to deploy your application!
