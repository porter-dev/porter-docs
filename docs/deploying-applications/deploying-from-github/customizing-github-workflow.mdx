title: Customizing your Github Workflow
---

It is possible to customize your Github workflow file after it is written to the repository. Porter offers several Github actions that allow you to customize your Github actions workflows to accommodate different workflows:

- [Update a Porter deployment](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-update-action#readme) -- this action runs a full update sequence (build, push, deploy) for a specific application on Porter.
- [Run a Porter job](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-porter-job) -- this action runs a job on Porter and waits for it to complete. This is most useful for running database migrations before deployment.
- [Run any CLI command](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-porter-cli) -- this action allows you to run any CLI command, so that you can compose your own workflows.

## Examples

<!-- ### Multi-Process Deployments

Applications are frequently deployed with multiple process types, such as web and workers. By default, Porter assumes that each repository runs one application type. However, if you have multiple process types -->

### Database Migrations and Jobs

When you set up a one-time job to deploy from a Github repository, the job will **not** run automatically -- the Github action will simply update the image used to run the job.

To get the Github action to run the job automatically, you can use [this Github action](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-run-job-action). For example:

```yaml
# ... the rest of your Github action
- name: Run Porter job
  uses: porter-dev/porter-run-job-action@v0.1.0
  with:
    job: <job-name> # TODO: replace w/ name of your job
    cluster: <cluster-id> # TODO: replace w/ cluster ID
    project: <project-id> # TODO: replace w/ project ID
    token: ${{ secrets.PORTER_TOKEN_12 }}
```
