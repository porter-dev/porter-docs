Porter lets you deploy a service directly from a Git repository. By default, services on Porter automatically update whenever there is a push to the primary branch (usually `main` or `master`) of the connected repo.

:::info Prerequisites

- A repository (public or private) hosted on GitHub
- A Kubernetes cluster and container registry linked to Porter (linked by default if you following the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started/overview))

:::

These docs will guide you through getting your applications set up and integrated with Github:

- [Adding/Updating the Porter Github App](doc:adding-the-porter-github-app) -- if you have not already linked a Github app, this guide will walk you through how to add/update the Github repositories that Porter has access to, and explains the Github app setup in more detail.
- [Selecting an Application and Build Method](doc:choosing-a-build-method) -- this guide documents the steps required to get your application linked up with Porter.
- [Customizing your Github Workflow](doc:customizing-your-github-workflow) -- explains how to modify your Github workflow, for example to run DB migrations or tests before deployment, and advanced configuration options like adding build-time environment variables.
