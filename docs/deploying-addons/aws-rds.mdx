Porter Databases allow you to spin up managed cloud databaser services, hosted by the same cloud provider running your Porter cluster. These databases are placed within the same VPC as the Porter cluster, allowing for a robust database setup accessible only to your application workloads. Currently, Porter Databases has support for AWS RDS PostgreSQL, with support for MySQL coming soon.
