### `porter run`

The `porter run` command allows users to execute a command on a remote container:

```
porter run [APP_NAME] -- [COMMAND] [args...]
```

The `APP_NAME` is the name of the application on the Porter dashboard (this can be a release either in the "Applications" or the "Jobs" tab).

### `porter run cleanup`

It can also cleanup residual instances of applications that may have been left behind as a result of a previous call to `porter run`:

```
porter run cleanup
```

You may learn more about ephemeral instances in the [Ephemeral Instances](/cli/remote-shell-access#ephemeral-pods) section.
