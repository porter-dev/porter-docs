:::info Prerequisites

- You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [`porter auth login`](./porter-auth)
- You're connected to the correct project by running [`porter config set-project`](./porter-config)
- You're connected to the correct cluster by running [`porter config set-cluster`](./porter-config)

:::

`porter port-forward` can be used to forward one or more local ports to a pod of a release and is used as follows:

```
porter port-forward [release] [LOCAL_PORT:]REMOTE_PORT [...[LOCAL_PORT_N:]REMOTE_PORT_N]
```

For people with Kubernetes experience, this command works exactly like `kubectl port-forward`.
