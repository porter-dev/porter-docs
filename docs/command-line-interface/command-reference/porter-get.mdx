`porter get` fetches basic information about a Porter application. It also supports outputting in the JSON and YAML formats.

#### Examples

To get information about a release named `sample-app`, you can run the following:

```
porter get sample-app
```

This command is namespace-scoped and uses the default namespace. To specify a different namespace, use the `--namespace` flag:

```
porter get sample-app --namespace custom-namespace
```

To output in a data interchange format such as JSON, use the `--output` flag:

```
porter get sample-app --output json
```

And similarly for YAML:

```
porter get sample-app --output yaml
```

### `porter get values`

This command can be used to fetch the Helm values of a release. For instance, to get the Helm values of a release named `sample-app`, you can run the following:

```
porter get values sample-app
```
