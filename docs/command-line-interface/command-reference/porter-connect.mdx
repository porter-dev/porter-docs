:::info Prerequisites

- You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [`porter auth login`](./porter-auth)
- You're connected to the correct project by running [`porter projects list`](./porter-project), and set the project via [`porter config set-project [PROJECT_ID]`](./porter-config)

`porter connect` contains commands for connecting to external clusters and providers.

## Cluster Connection

### `porter connect kubeconfig`

This connects an existing Kubernetes cluster with a Porter instance. By default, this command will read the `current-context` that's set in your default `kubeconfig` (either by reading the `$KUBECONFIG` env variable or reading from `$HOME/.kube/config`). You can also pass a path to a kubeconfig file explicitly (see examples).

#### Examples

You can pass a path to a `kubeconfig` file explicitly via:

```sh
porter connect kubeconfig --kubeconfig path/to/kubeconfig
```

You can initialize Porter with a set of contexts by passing a context list to start. The contexts that Porter will be able to access are the same as `kubectl config get-contexts`. For example, if there are two contexts named `minikube` and `staging`, you could connect both of them via:

```sh
porter connect kubeconfig --contexts minikube --contexts staging
```

#### Details

The Porter CLI will attempt to generate a working kubeconfig for many types of cluster configurations and auth mechanisms, even though the necessary commands and/or certificates will not be available on a filepath in the Porter instance. The CLI will attempt the following resolutions:

- If a kubeconfig requires cluster CA data via the `certificate-authority` field, the CA data will be automatically populated.
- If a kubeconfig requires client cert data via the `client-certificate` field, the certificate data will be automatically populated.
- If a kubeconfig requires client key data via the `client-key` field, the key data will be automatically populated.
- If a kubeconfig requires a custom `oidc` auth mechanism, and this mechanism requires OIDC issuer CA data via the `idp-certificate-authority` field, the CA data will be automatically populated.
- If a kubeconfig requires a bearer token to be read from a `token-file` field, the token data will be automatically populated.
- If a kubeconfig requires a custom AWS mechanism (through either `aws eks get-token` or `aws-iam-authenticator`), the CLI will require an AWS IAM user that has permissions on the cluster. This user can be supplied manually or the Porter CLI can attempt to create this user automatically.
- If a kubeconfig requires a custom `gcp` auth mechanism (for connecting with GKE clusters), the CLI will require a GCP `service-account` that has permissions to read from the GKE cluster. The CLI will ask the user if it can set this up automatically: if so, it will automatically detect the correct GCP project ID and will create a service account and download a key file. If the user does not wish the CLI to set this up automatically, the user will need to provide a file path to a service account key file that was downloaded from GCloud.
