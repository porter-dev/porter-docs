:::info Beta Notice

Preview environments are currently in `beta` and are not enabled on Porter projects by default. Please reach out on Discord or over email if you'd like to participate in beta-testing preview environments.

:::

_Preview environments_ are isolated instances of your application used for testing purposes. You can configure Porter to create a preview environment for every new pull request made to your Github repository. There are three steps required to get preview environments working with your application:

- Make sure preview environments are enabled for your cluster
- Preview environments enabled for your desired Github repository
- A `porter.yaml` file at the root of your repository

## Enable Preview Environments for your Cluster

To enable preview environments for your cluster, navigate to the [cluster dashboard](https://dashboard.getporter.dev/cluster-dashboard). If preview environments are enabled for your project, you will see the first tab of the cluster listed as **Preview Environments**. Click **Enable Preview Environments** to enable them for your cluster.

## Enable Preview Environments for your Repository

Next, you should enable preview environments for your specific repository. To do this, click on the **Add Repository** button and select the repository that you wish to enable preview environments in. If you're not seeing the correct list of repositories, follow the instructions [here](../deploying-applications/deploying-from-github/adding-or-updating-porter-gh-app.mdx#updating-the-porter-github-app) to add your repository. Then, click **Add Repository** again, and preview environments will be enabled for your repository.

:::info

To remove preview environments from a repository, click on the **Configure** button, which will pull up a list of the repositories where preview environments are currently enabled. Click on the delete icon next to the repository to remove the integration.

:::

## Create a `porter.yaml` File

The last step is to create a `porter.yaml` file for your application. This file specifies the list of applications and addons that you'd like to deploy, and the build configuration settings for your application. Here's an example `porter.yaml` file:

```yaml
# The YAML reference version: v1 is the only option for now
version: v1

# A list of resources to create
resources:
  - # The name of this resource
    name: example

    # The source for this repository. Defaults to the web, worker, and job applications by default.
    source:
      name: web

    # The configuration for the application or addon.
    config:
      # The build configuration for the application.
      build:
        method: pack
      # The runtime configuration for the application.
      values:
        container:
          command: go-getting-started
          port: 8080
          env:
            normal:
              BPE_PORT: "8080"
```

Now that the repository has been added and the `porter.yaml` file has been created, new PRs created will trigger a new preview environment, and updates to that PR will re-build and re-deploy the environment. Each time the preview environment is deployed, a Github comment will be added to the PR indicating the URL that the PR is deployed on:

## Github App Permissions

If you previously installed the Porter Github App in your Github account, you will receive an email requesting updated permissions for the Github app. **If you do not wish to test preview environments at this time, you can ignore this email**. The existing Porter Github App will still work.

This section details the **updated permissions** that the Porter Github App is requesting.
