This preview environments driver can be used to read environment variables that contain the prefix `PORTER_APPLY_`.

For example, to read in all the environment variables that start with `PORTER_APPLY_`:

```yaml
---
resources:
  - name: my-os-env
    driver: os-env
```

### Outputs

This driver outputs all the environment variables that start with `PORTER_APPLY_`. This means that if an environment variable is named `PORTER_APPLY_my_secret`, this driver will output a `my_secret` identifier:

```yaml
---
resources:
  - name: my-os-env
    driver: os-env
  - name: my-deployment
    depends_on:
      - my-os-env
    source:
      name: web
    config:
      values:
        container:
          env:
            normal:
              MY_SECRET_VALUE: {{ .my-os-env.my_secret }}
```
