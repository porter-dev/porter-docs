:::info

- This driver requires the [`target.app_name`](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourcetarget) field to be set to the Porter release name.
- The [`source`](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourcesource) section does not need to be set for this driver.

:::

This preview environments driver can be used to push a local Docker image to a linked registry on Porter. The [`config`](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourceconfig) section, when using this driver, supports the following properties:

- `push` [`Object`, required] - options to push the image, with the following properties:
  - `use_pack_cache` [`Boolean`, optional] - whether to use the pack cache when pushing the image
  - `image` [`String`, required] - the name of the local Docker image to push

For example, to push a local Docker image to a linked registry, you can use the following:

```yaml
---
resources:
  - name: my-pushed-image
    driver: push-image
    target:
      app_name: my-porter-release
    config:
      push:
        image: us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/my-gcp-project/my-gar-repo/my-image:f00bar1
```

### Outputs
