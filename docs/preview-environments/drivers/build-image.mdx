:::info

- This driver requires the [`target.app_name`](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourcetarget) field to be set to the Porter release name.
- The [`source.name`](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourcesource) field should use the name of the Helm chart that the Porter release is going to use.

:::

This preview environments driver can be used to build a Docker image locally by using some details from the intended Porter release that is being deployed using the built image. The [`config`](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourceconfig) section, when using this driver, supports the following properties:

- `build` [`Object`, required] - options to build the image, with the following properties:
  - `use_pack_cache` [`Boolean`, optional] - whether to use the pack cache when building the image, when using the `pack` method
  - `method` [`String`, required] - one of `docker`, `pack` ([Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io)) or `registry`
  - `context` [`String`, optional] - the current build context or working directory to use, relative to the root directory. Defaults to the current working directory.
  - `dockerfile` [`String`, required only when `method` is `docker`] - path to the Dockerfile to use, relative to the root directory. Defaults to `./Dockerfile`.
  - `image` [`String`, required only when `method` is `registry`] - the container image URI to use including the full image path and the tag
  - `builder` [`String`, optional] - the Buildpacks [builder](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/) to use when using the `pack` method. Defaults to `paketobuildpacks/builder:full`.
  - `buildpacks` [`Array of Strings`, optional] - the list of [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/buildpack/) to use, when using the `pack` method
  - `env` [`Map of String keys to String values`, optional] - the environment variables to use for the build
- `env_groups` [`Array of Objects`, optional] - list of env groups to use to build the app or addon, supporting the following properties:
  - `name` [`String`, required] - the name of the env group
  - `namespace` [`String`, required] - the namespace to use for the env group
  - `version` [`Integer`, optional] - the version of the env group
- `values` [`Map of String keys to Object values`, optional] - the Helm chart values to use for the app or addon

For example, to build a Docker image locally using the `pack` method, you can use the following:

```yaml
---
resources:
  - name: my-image
    driver: build-image
    source:
      name: web
    target:
      app_name: my-porter-release
    config:
      build:
        method: pack
        builder: heroku/builder:20
      values:
        container:
          env:
            normal:
              FOO: BAR
```

### Outputs

This driver outputs the following identifiers:

- `registry_url` - the domain part of the image URI
- `image_repo` - the repository name from the image URI
- `image_tag` - the image tag
- `image` - the full URI of the image
