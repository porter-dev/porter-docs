title: Porter YAML Reference
---

This document contains a full reference file for `porter.yaml`. Each `porter.yaml` file has the following high-level structure:

- [`version`](#version) - the version of the `porter.yaml` file reference to use.
- [`resources`](#resources) - a list of resources to create.
  - [`name`](#resourcename) - the unique ID of the resource.
  - [`driver`](#resourcedriver) - the name of the driver to use for the resource.
  - [`depends_on`](#resourcedepends_on) - the resources that the target resources depends on.
  - [`source`](#resourcesource) - the source configuration, specifying the application/addon to use.
  - [`target`](#resourcetarget) - the target configuration, specifying the specifics of the project, cluster, etc., the application/addon should be deployed to.
  - [`config`](#resourceconfig) - the build and runtime configuration for the addon or application.

## `version`

The version of the `porter.yaml` file reference to use. Currently, only `v1` is supported:

```yaml
version: v1
```

## `resources`

A list of resources to create. For example:

```yaml
---
resources:
  - name: "resource-1"
    source:
      name: "web"
  - name: "resource-2"
    depends_on:
      - "resource-1"
    source:
      name: "web"
```

### `<resource>.name`

The name of the resource to create.

### `<resource>.driver`

The name of the driver the resource should use. For more about drivers, see the [Drivers section](./drivers) of the documentation.

### `<resource>.depends_on`

A list of resources that the target resource depends on.

```yaml
---
resources:
  - name: "resource-1"
    source:
      name: "web"
  - name: "resource-2"
    depends_on:
      - "resource-1"
```

### `<resource>.source`

The source specifies the application/addon to deploy for this resource. More specifically, it uniquely identifies a Helm chart. It contains the following fields:

- `name` \[`String`, required\] - the name of the template to use. Since the default source repo is https://charts.getporter.dev, the names `web`, `worker`, and `job` work by default.
- `repo` \[`String`, optional\] - the Helm repository URL to use. Currently supported are `https://charts.getporter.dev` and `https://chart-addons.getporter.dev`.
- `version` \[`String`, optional\] - the semver version of the chart to use. If no version is specified, the latest version is used.

For example, to deploy a worker application:

```yaml
---
resources:
  - name: "web-example"
    source:
      name: "worker" # this could also be "web" or "job"
```

To deploy `postgresql`, a supported addon:

```yaml
---
resources:
  - name: "postgres"
    source:
      name: "postgresql"
      repo: "https://chart-addons.getporter.dev"
```

### `<resource>.target`

The target specifies the specifics of the project, cluster, etc., the application/addon should be deployed to. More specifically, it contains the following fields:

- `project` \[`Integer`, optional\] - the Porter project ID to deploy the resource to. This is resolved in the following manner:
  - Checks for the `PORTER_PROJECT` environment variable and uses it if it is set to a non-zero value.
  - Next, checks for the value of `target.project` in the `porter.yaml` file and uses it if it is set to a non-zero value.
  - Lastly, defaults back to the CLI configuration value for the project, set by using the `porter config set-project` command.
- `cluster` \[`Integer`, optional\] - the Porter cluster ID in the project to deploy the resource to. This is resolved in the following manner:
  - Checks for the `PORTER_CLUSTER` environment variable and uses it if it is set to a non-zero value.
  - Next, checks for the value of `target.cluster` in the `porter.yaml` file and uses it if it is set to a non-zero value.
  - Lastly, defaults back to the CLI configuration value for the cluster, set by using the `porter config set-cluster` command.
- `namespace` \[`String`, optional\] - the namespace in the cluster to deploy the resource to. This is resolved in the following manner:
  - Checks for the `PORTER_NAMESPACE` environment variable and uses it if it is set to a non-empty string.
  - Next, checks for the value of `target.namespace` in the `porter.yaml` file and uses it if it is set to a non-empty string.
  - Lastly, uses the `default` namespace if the above steps do not resolve to a non-empty string value.

For example, to deploy a resource to a specific project, cluster, and namespace:

```yaml
---
resources:
  - name: "web-example"
    target:
      project: 1
      cluster: 1
      namespace: "dev"
```

### `<resource>.config`

The `config` block specifies build and runtime configuration for the application or addon.

#### Application Config

If the resource is a `web`, `worker`, or `job` application, the `config` block expects the following fields:

- `build` \[required\] - the build configuration to use.
  - `method` \[`docker`, `pack`, or `registry`\] - the build/deploy method to use: the Docker daemon, cloud-native buildpacks or deployment from a Docker registry.
  - `dockerfile` \[`String`, optional\] - if the build method is `docker`, the path to the Dockerfile. Defaults to `./Dockerfile`.
  - `builder` \[`String`, optional\] - if the build method is `pack`, the builder to use. Leaving this blank will default to `paketobuildpacks/builder:full`. Other well-supported options are `heroku/buildpacks:20` and `heroku/buildpacks:18`.
  - `buildpacks` \[`String`, optional\] - if the build method is `pack`, the buildpacks to use. Leaving this empty will default to the buildpacks supported by `paketo` and `heroku`, depending on the builder.
  - `context` \[`String`, optional\] - if the build method is `docker` or `pack`, the path to the application directory. Defaults to the current (root) directory.
  - `image` \[`String`, required if `method=registry`\] - the image repo URL to deploy from, if the build method is `registry`.
- `values` \[required\] - the [runtime configuration](#runtime-configuration) to use.

If the resource is an addon, the `config` block corresponds directly to the [runtime configuration](#runtime-configuration).

#### Runtime Configuration

The options for the runtime configuration (`config.values` for applications, `config` for addons) corresponds to the default Helm values for the application. If you have experience with Kubernetes/Helm, you can also view all possible configuration options in the `values.yaml` files of the respective applications: [`web`](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/web/values.yaml), [`worker`](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/worker/values.yaml), and [`job`](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/job/values.yaml). If you don't have this experience, please see the [examples](./examples) to view common configuration options.

#### Variable References

It is possible to reference output values from another resource to set configuration for the current resource. The syntax to reference dependent variables is as follows:

```
"{ .<resource_name>.<jsonpath> }"
```

The `<jsonpath>` section follows [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e2) syntax. Most of the time, this will simply be a set of nested fields. For example, the `postgresql` addon outputs a fields `postgresqlPassword` and `postgresqlUsername`, so a resource named `postgres` can be referenced via:

```yaml
POSTGRES_USERNAME: "{ .postgres.postgresqlUsername }"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "{ .postgres.postgresqlPassword }"
```
